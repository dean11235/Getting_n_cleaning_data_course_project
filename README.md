# Getting_n_cleaning_data_course_project Repository, Submitted by Dean Nguyen. 

This repository has the code and instruction to run analysis on Human Activity Recognition dataset

CodeBook.md : a code book that describes the data and the transformations or work that was conducted to clean up the dataset 

run_analysis.R is an R script. It downloads and prepares data for analysis. THen, it performs analysis in the following 5 steps (as described in the project prompt) :
    
    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalTidyData.txt is the output of the final step
